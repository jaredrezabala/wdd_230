            <img src="images/honda-pcx150.jpg" alt="Honda PCX150 (149cc) - 2 person">
            <p>With an automatic transmission, nimble maneuverability, and underseat storage a scooter is a great choice
                for those dealing with congested city roads/parking lot mayhem. A modern-styled scooter like the 2020
                Honda PCX150 is optimal for the around-town rat race because it features a 149cc engine encased under
                sporty bodywork. It has plenty of legroom, side- and centerstand, LED lighting throughout, 12-volt
                accessory adapter, 7 gallons of storage, and a stepped saddle for a comfortable two-up ride. ABS is an
                option at a $300 increase.</p>

            <h4>Honda Pioneer 1000 - 4 person

            <img src="images/honda-pioneer1000.jpg" alt="Honda Pioneer 1000 - 4 person">
            <p>The four-door Pioneer 1000-6 Crew measures 152.2 inches (3,866 mm) long, 63 inches wide (1,600 mm) wide,
                and 76.1 inches (1933 mm) tall, with a wheelbase of 115.2 inches (2,926 mm). This makes it 35,1 inches
                (892 mm) longer than the two-door Pioneer 1000. The stretched wheelbase results in 28 inches (711 mm) of
                legroom which according to Honda is best-in-class. Besides the full-size rear bed, there is also
                under-seat storage in both rows.</p>
